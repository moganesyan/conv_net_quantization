### Quantizing Convolutional Neural Networks
Trying to implement DoReFa-Net (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06160) in order to quantize the weights, activations and gradients of a CNN.

Furthermore, trying to sweep the bitwidths (2bits, 3bits, ..., full precision) in order to find the optimal quantization level
